## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, email [security@deraw.dev](mailto:me@deraw.dev?subject=SECURITY) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
